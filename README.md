### Business Insights

- We can see that, during month of May, Aug-2019 and Aug, Dec, Jan-2020 and Feb, Aug-2022 the sales of coffee was low, but there is no regular pattern in this trend. So, the sales is not affected by years.
- We have better sales with the customers who has loyalty card. So, we can promote cards to more customers by giving discounts or points that can be claimed.
- Light roast coffee is sold the most next to medium and dark roast. So, we should maintain light and medium roast coffee powder 20% more compared to dark roast powder.
- We can see that the overall sales is given by United States which is 4 times higher than other two states. So, we should concentrate more on United Kingdom and Ireland to increase sales.
- We also have top 5 customers who had given the most sales to the company, so we can give additional discounts to those customers to make them happy and retain constant coffee sales with them.
- We can conduct a campain to get more feedback from customers in all countries which will be helpful to increase customer satisfaction.
